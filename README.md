## Description
The project reads in a zip file, which contains images of newspapers and creates a dictionary instance for each page with the text and a contact-sheet of all human faces in the page.  
When a particular word is searched using the 'search()' function, it searches for the word in each page and returns the conatc-sheet of the page in which the word is found.
If a word is found in a page with no facial images, appropriate message is notified.


#### P.S : The images.zip file used in the project can be found in the readonly folder located in the link given above.
